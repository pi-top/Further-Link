============
Further Link
============

Further Link is a web server application, intended to run on `pi-top`_
hardware, which allows communicating with the device from `pi-top Further`_.

The primary use case of this is to remotely run Further user's code (python3
usually) on the pi-top, with full interactivity via a websocket api.

Additional features include uploading files; interactive shell sessions;
additional IO capabilities, such as video output and keyboard event input,
though an inbuilt python library (see `examples <examples>`_).

`further-link` is included out-of-the-box with pi-topOS.

Ensure that you keep your system up-to-date to enjoy the latest features and
bug fixes.

This application is installed as a Python 3 script that is managed by a systemd
service, configured to automatically run on startup and restart during software
updates.
