## Overview
The core of this project is an `aiohttp` websocket server which uses `asyncio`
subprocesses to run code or interactaive sessions for the user and provide
access to their stdin/stdout/stderr streams. Files can be uploaded to an
application-managed directory for use in the execution. There is also a system
of additional IO streams, for uses such as video output and keyboard events,
which can be used with a Python [package](../further_link/__init__.py) provided with
the server.

## Development usage
The project requires Python 3.7+. The dependencies, command line tool and
associated python package can be installed (optionally in a virtualenv) in a
clone of the repo by running:
```
pip3 install -e ".[test]"
sudo mk-build-deps -i
```

Run the tests with:
```
pytest
```

Run the server for development with:
```
FURTHER_LINK_NOSSL=1 python3 further_link/__main__.py
```

Confirm the server is running with:
```
curl http://localhost:8028/status
```

## Configuration
### Port
The default server port, __8028__, can be overridden by setting
FURTHER_LINK_PORT env variable.

### SSL/TLS
The server uses TLS by default but the required certificates are not
provided in this repository. For development and testing you can disable TLS
by setting environment variable FURTHER_LINK_NOSSL=1. Alternatively, you can
provide your own certificate and key files by placing them in the `extra`
directory with the names `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.

### Working directory
The default working directory where files are uploaded and executed from is
`~/further`. This can be overridden by setting env var FURTHER_LINK_WORK_DIR.
For more information related to the `run-py` API see the options of the
`upload` and `start` messages in the documentation below.

## API
### HTTP Post /upload
- Body should be a JSON object with `name` of directory to upload into and
  `files` object. Files are provided as `text` type, with the text content, or
  `url` type, with a url for the file to be downloaded from
  ([example](../tests/test_data/upload_data.py)). Responds after creating files is
  complete with a simple 200 OK.

### Websocket Endpoint /run-py
Each websocket client connected on `/run-py` can manage a single python process
at a time.

#### Example usage
- Connect websocket on `/run-py` (using [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat)):
```
websocat ws://localhost:8028/run-py
```
- Send `start` command with `sourceScript`:
```
{ "type": "start", "data": { "sourceScript": "print('hi')" } }
```
- Receive `stdout` response:
```
{ "type": "stdout", "data": { "output": "hi\n" } }
```
- Receive `stopped` response:
```
{ "type": "stopped", "data": { "exitCode": 0 } }
```

#### Spec
##### Options
This connection has some options which can be selected with query
parameters:

```
/run-py?user=root
```
The `user` parameter is used to select the Linux user which the code is
executed as. By default the `pi` user is selected if it exists, otherwise
the user executing the server is used.

```
/run-py?pty=1
```
The pty parameter, if set to 1 or true, will create a pseudoterminal interface
for the python process IO streams, in order to provide terminal behaviours such
as 'cooked mode'. This is useful to produce identical behaviour of programs to
that on the command line and to easily interface with terminal emulators such
as [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/).

##### Message Types
Websocket messages sent between client and server must be in JSON with two top
level properties: required string `type` and optional object `data`.

Message types accepted by the server are:
```
{
 "type":"[ping|start|stop|stdin|upload|keyevent]",
 "data": {...}
}
```

Message types sent from the server are:
```
{
 "type":"[pong|error|started|stopped|stdout|stderr|uploaded|keylisten]",
 "data": {...}
}
```

Message and response details:
- `ping` command from the client will be met with a `pong` response from
    the server. This can be used to keep the socket active to prevent automatic
    closures.
- `pong` response is sent by the server immediately after a `ping` is received
<br>

- `error` response is sent for bad commands or server errors e.g. `data: { message: "something went wrong and it's not your python code" }`
<br>

- `start` command will start a new python process. The code to run can be
    specified in data as either a `souceScript` or `sourcePath`. For
    `sourceScript` an additional `directoryName` can be passed to specify an
    (uploaded) directory to run the script in, within the work dir, otherwise
    `/tmp` is used. If `sourcePath` is not absolute, it is assumed to be
    relative to the work dir.
    e.g. `data: {sourceScript:"print('hi')", directoryName: "myproject"}`
    or `data: {sourcePath: "myproject/run.py"}`
- `started` response is sent after a successful process `start`, has no data.
<br>

- `stdin` command is used to send data to process stdin e.g. `data: { input: "this can be read by python\n" }`.
- `stdout` response is sent when process prints to stdout. e.g. `data: { output: "this was printed by python" }`
- `stderr` response is sent when process prints to stderr e.g. `data: { output: "Traceback bleh bleh" }`
<br>

- `stop` command is used to stop a running process early, has no data.
- `stopped` response is sent when a process finished and has the exit code in e.g. `data: { exitCode: 0 }`
<br>

- `upload` command is used to create a directory of files in the work dir.
    Files are provided in the data as `text` type, with the text content, or
    `url` type, with a url for the file to be downloaded from.
    [Example](..tests/test_data/upload_data.py)
- `uploaded` response is sent after a successful upload , has no data.
<br>

- `video` response is sent by the server with data.output containing a base64
    encoded mjpeg frame for the client to render as a video feed.
<br>

- `keylisten` message is sent by the server to indicate it would like to
    receive keyboard events from the client for a specific key. This would be
    initiated by user code using the further_link.KeyboardButton python module.
    Keys are specified as web [KeyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
    strings e.g. `data: { key: "ArrowUp" }`
- `keyevent` message is sent by the client to provide keyboard events to the
    server so that they can be forwarded to user code using
    further_link.KeyboardButton. The data includes a key string matching those
    used in `keylisten` and an event string which is either "keydown" or
    "keyup" e.g. `data: { key: "ArrowUp", event: "keydown" }`
<br>

### Websocket Endpoint /run
Each websocket client connected on `/run` can manage multuiple processes of
different types, addressing them by a unique id.

#### Example usage
- Connect websocket on `/run` (using [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat)):
```
websocat ws://localhost:8028/run
```

- Send `start` command for process id 1, requesting `runner` "python3" and `code`:
```
{ "type": "start", "process": "1", "data": { "runner": "python3", "code": "print('hi')" } }
```

- Receive `started` response with expected id:
```
{ "type": "started", "process": "1" }
```

- Send `start` command for process id 2 requesting `runner` "shell":
```
{ "type": "start", "process": "2", "data": { "runner": "shell" } }
```

- Receive `started` response with expected id:
```
{ "type": "started", "process": "2" }
```

- Send `stdin` to shell process with id 2:
```
{ "type": "stdin", "process": "2", "data": { "input": "ls\n" } }
```

- Receive `stdout` response from python:
```
{ "type": "stdout", "process": "1", "data": { "output": "hi\n" } }
```

- Receive `stdout` response from shell:
```
{ "type": "stdout", "process": "2", "data": { "output": ".\n..\nfile.txt\n" } }
```

- Receive `stopped` response from python:
```
{ "type": "stopped", "process": "1", "data": { "exitCode": 0 } }
```

#### Spec
##### Options
This connection has some options which can be selected with query
parameters:

```
/run?user=root
```
The `user` parameter is used to select the Linux user which the code is
executed as. By default the `pi` user is selected if it exists, otherwise
the user executing the server is used.

```
/run?pty=1

##### Message Types
Websocket messages sent between client and server are in JSON with three top
level properties: required string `type`, optional string `process` and optional object `data`.

Message types accepted by the server are:
```
{
 "type":"[ping|start|stop|stdin|resize|keyevent]",
 "data": {...},
 "process": "id"
}
```

Message types sent from the server are:
```
{
 "type":"[pong|error|started|stopped|stdout|stderr|keylisten]",
 "data": {...},
 "process": "id"
}
```

Message and response details:
Connection management - these messages don't require a process id
- `ping` command from the client will be met with a `pong` response from
    the server. This can be used to keep the socket active to prevent automatic
    closures.
- `pong` response is sent by the server immediately after a `ping` is received
<br>

- `error` response is sent for bad commands or server errors e.g. `data: { message: "something went wrong and it's not your python code" }`
<br>

Basic:
// TODO non python!
- `start` command will start a new python process. This can run an existing
    python file or create one from the `code` data field. The `path` data field
    is used to specify the path of a python file to run, or the directory in
    which to create the file from `code`. The working directory for the python
    process is the directory the entrypoint file is in, or /tmp. If `path` is
    not absolute, it is assumed to be relative to the further link working
    directory described above.

    e.g.
    `data: {code:"print('hi')"}`
    `data: {code:"print('hi')", path: "myproject"}`
    `data: {path: "myproject/run.py"}`
    `data: {path: "/home/pi/run.py"}`

- `started` response is sent after a successful process `start`, has no data.
<br>

- `stdin` command is used to send data to process stdin e.g. `data: { input: "this can be read by python\n" }`.
- `stdout` response is sent when process prints to stdout. e.g. `data: { output: "this was printed by python" }`
- `stderr` response is sent when process prints to stderr e.g. `data: { output: "Traceback bleh bleh" }`
<br>

- `stop` command is used to stop a running process early, has no data.
- `stopped` response is sent when a process finished and has the exit code in e.g. `data: { exitCode: 0 }`
<br>

Advanced
- `video` response is sent by the server with data.output containing a base64
    encoded mjpeg frame for the client to render as a video feed.
<br>

- `keylisten` message is sent by the server to indicate it would like to
    receive keyboard events from the client for a specific key. This would be
    initiated by user code using the further_link.KeyboardButton python module.
    Keys are specified as web [KeyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
    strings e.g. `data: { key: "ArrowUp" }`
- `keyevent` message is sent by the client to provide keyboard events to the
    server so that they can be forwarded to user code using
    further_link.KeyboardButton. The data includes a key string matching those
    used in `keylisten` and an event string which is either "keydown" or
    "keyup" e.g. `data: { key: "ArrowUp", event: "keydown" }`
<br>

There is no upload message for this api. The separate http endpoint should be
used instead.

### Ideas
- Other languages & environments (SonicPi, .NET interactive...)
- Connection security via login or codes displayed on OLED
- Detaching, reattaching to long running programs
- Device status endpoints eg battery
- Queueing system to enable safe hardware sharing
- Device registration to remote server to provide easier connection
- More IO extensions eg chart plotting, ui events
